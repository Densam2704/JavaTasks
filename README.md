# JavaTasks
Practicing simple algorithms on Java
Tasks were taken from https://habr.com/ru/post/440436/
Each task is in its own package. 
In order to run task, you need to create an example of task class.
(For instance: Part3_Recursion.Task3.Task3 p3task3 = new Part3_Recursion.Task3.Task3();)

List of completed tasks:

 1. Basics
 1.1 Create random array. Find max, min, avg.
 1.2 Create random array. Perform bubble sort algorithm
 1.3 Get all primes from given interval
 1.4 Delete all occurrences of given number in array.

 2. OOP
 2.1 Vector in 3D
